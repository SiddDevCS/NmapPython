# Simple Customized Python Nmap Scanner

Just getting more familiar with scripting in Python, that's why I decided to customize my Nmap scans with the Nmap Python module.

---

# Usage:

1.
```bash
git clone
cd /
```

2. 
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3.
```python
python3 main.py
```

From there just follow the instructions, you will be prompted :)
